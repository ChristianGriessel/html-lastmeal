            Thank you, <font color = "gold">precious father</font>, for coming today and shepherding me into faith. 
            I want to thank my beautiful wife who has loved me with everything she has. 
            I want to thank my friends and legal team, and most of all, <font color = "gold">Jesus Christ</font> 
            through this unfair judicial process that led to my salvation. 
            I pray the <font color = "gold">Lord</font> will have mercy on all of us and that the <font color = "gold">Lord</font> will have mercy on me.</p>
